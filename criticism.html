		<p class="criticismtext">Some feminists have critiqued Surrealism, claiming that it is fundamentally a male movement and a male fellowship. Some feminist critics believe that it adopts archaic attitudes toward women, such as worshiping them symbolically through stereotypes and sexist norms. Women are often made to represent higher values and transformed into objects of desire and of mystery.</p>

		<p class="criticismtext">A pioneer in the feminist critique of Surrealism was Xavière Gauthier, whose book, Surréalisme et sexualité (1971), inspired further scholarship on the marginalization of women in relation to "the avant-garde". This perspective was anticipated and critiqued as misunderstanding Surrealism's point in being a social critique and a reflection on the individual's presuppositions so that they may be critically questioned. Wolfgang Paalen eventually was the only Surrealist to defend feminism, although in a very archaic sense. However it was Leonora Carrington, who called Paalen "the only feminist of the whole group".</p>

		<p class="criticismtext">Art historian Whitney Chadwick has countered the critique of Surrealism: "Surrealism also battled the social institutions - church, state, and family - that regulate the place of women within patriarchy. In offering some women their first locus for artistic and social resistance, it became the first modernist movement in which a group of women could explore female subjectivity and give form (however tentatively) to a feminine imaginary."</p>
